> [!example] The Cobb-Douglas Production Function
> The Cobb-Douglas production function with two inputs is given by $f(z_{1},z_{2}) = z_{1}^{\alpha}z_{2}^{\beta}$, where $\alpha\geq 0,\ \beta\geq 0$. 

The MRTS between the two inputs at $z = (z_{1},z_{2})$ is, 
$$
\begin{align}
\text{MRTS}_{12}(z) &  = \frac{\partial f(z_{1},z_{2}) / \partial z_{1}}{\partial f(z_{1},z_{2}) / \partial z_{2}} \\
 & = \frac{\alpha z_{2}}{\beta z_{1}}
\end{align}
$$
