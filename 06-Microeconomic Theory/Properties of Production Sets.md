### Returns to Scale 
- CRTS and NIRTS
	- **Relation:** CRTS is a special case of NIRTS 
	- CRTS requires that scaling inputs by a factor $\alpha$ scales output by the same factor, which satisfies the NIRTS condition ($f(\alpha x)\geq \alpha f(x)$)
- CRTS and NDRTS: 
	- **Relation:** CRTS is a special case of NDRTS
	- NDRTS encompasses both CRTS and IRTS, CRTS maintains proportional scaling, which inherently satisfies the non-decreasing condition 
- CRTS Implies Convexity of $Y$ 
	- **Relation:** CRTS implies that $Y$ is a convex cone 
	- Under CRTS, scaling proportionally maintains feasibility, aligning with the definition of a convex cone where any positive scaling and convex combinations of feasible points remains feasible. 
- Additivity and NIRTS implies CRTS and Convexity of Y
	- **Relation:** [[Additive and NIRTS Y iff CRTS and Convex Y]]
	- Additivity allows for the combination of production plans, and when coupled with NIRTS, it ensures that the scaling and combining of production plans uphold CRTS and maintains the convexity of $Y$ 

### Convexity and Concavity in Production 

##### Concave Production Functions Imply Convex Production Sets 

If the production function $f$ is concave, then the production set $Y$ is convex. A concave production function ensures that for any two production plans, their convex combination yields an output that is at least as great as the convex combination of their individual outputs, satisfying the convexity of $Y$. 

### Structural Properties of $Y$ 

##### $Y$ is a Convex cone Implies homogeneity and Convexity

If $Y$ is a convex cone, it implies that the production function exhibits homogeneity of degree $\hspace{0pt}1$, hence CRTS, and $Y$ is convex. 

#### $Y$ is non-empty and closed enhances convexity 
• **Relation:** Being non-empty and closed complements convexity in  Y .
• **Explanation:** These properties ensure that  Y  is well-defined and that limit points of feasible production plans are included, supporting both convexity and the application of optimization techniques.

### Free Disposal and Possibility of Inaction 

#### Free Disposal Enhances Convexity 
• **Relation:** **Free Disposal** implies that reducing inputs or outputs cannot make a production plan infeasible, contributing to the convexity of  Y .
• **Explanation:** Free disposal allows firms to discard excess inputs or outputs without cost, ensuring that scaled-down production plans remain feasible and thereby supporting the convex structure of  Y .

#### Possibility of Inaction and Convexity 
• **Relation:** **Possibility of Inaction** (not engaging in any production) implies that the origin is included in  Y , which is a necessary condition for  Y  to be a convex cone.
• **Explanation:** Including the origin ensures that zero production is feasible, allowing for the scaling down of production plans to zero, which is consistent with convexity.

### Irreversibility in Production 

#### Irreversibility and Convexity
• **Relation:** **Irreversibility** supports the convexity of  Y  by ensuring that scaling down production plans remains feasible.
• **Explanation:** Irreversibility allows for the proportional reduction of inputs and outputs, maintaining feasibility and thus contributing to the convex nature of  Y .

#### Irreversibility and Returns to Scale
• **Relation:** Irreversibility interacts with returns to scale by ensuring that production plans can be adjusted downward without violating feasibility, which is particularly relevant under CRTS and NIRTS.
• **Explanation:** This property ensures that firms have the flexibility to respond to changes in market conditions, supporting efficient resource allocation under various returns to scale scenarios.

### Additivity 

#### Additivity and Convexity
• **Relation:** **Additivity** (free-entry) implies that the production set  Y  is closed under addition, which is a component of convexity.
• **Explanation:** If firms can freely enter production plans, combining multiple production plans remains feasible, supporting the convex structure of  Y .

#### Additivity and Homogeneity
• **Relation:** When combined with NIRTS, additivity ensures that  Y  is a convex cone, aligning with CRTS.
• **Explanation:** Additivity allows for the merging of production plans, and under NIRTS, this merging maintains the properties required for CRTS and convexity.
