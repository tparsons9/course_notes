# Micro Notes 
### Monopoly 

The following two results hold for **Constant MC** 

> [!proposition] 
> $q(p)p - c\cdot q(p)$ is quasiconcave in $p$ if $1 / q(p)$ is convex 


> [!proposition] 
> $\frac{1}{f}$ is convex if $\ln f$ is concave ($f$ is log-concave)

Question, is $\ln q(p)$ concave? **COMEBACKTO** 

Note that many functions have log concavity, if you get stuck, try log concavity. 

## $M$.$C$.$S$. (Monotone Comparative Statics) 

About the standard problem in economics, we solve a optimization problem and ask what happens when one of the parameters changes. 
Note that we don't need to look at the 3rd results in the notes. We only should look at supermodularity and single crossing. 

##### Setup 
$f: \mathbb{R}^{2}\to\mathbb{R}$, $X\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. 
$$
\max_{x\in X}f(x,t)
$$
$$
X^{*}(t) = \arg \max_{x\in X} f(x, t)
$$
and $x^{*}(t)$. 

Our questions are when either $X^{*}(t)$ or $x^{*}(t)$ is _increasing in $t$_. Note that $X^{*}(t)$ is a set and $x^{*}(t)$ is an element in the set. If we say that $x^{*}(t)$ is increasing in $t$, does that mean that all elements in $X^{*}(t)$ are increasing in t? We don't know, which is why we want to look at the monotonicity properties of the entire set. Of course, this is meaningless if the solution is a singleton. 

Assume $f$ is twice continuously differentiable, that $f_{xx}<0$ and $x^{*}(t)\in \text{int}(X)$. The FOC are that $f_{x}(x^{*}(t), t) = 0$. Take the derivative of the equation with respect to $t$. Leads to: 
$$
x^{*'}(t) = - \frac{f_{xt}(x^{*}(t), t)}{f_{x x}(x^{*}(t), t)} 
$$
and given our conditions, 
$$
\text{sign }x^{*'}(t) = \text{sign }f_{xt}(x^{*}(t), t)
$$
Why this is not satisfactory: It assumes, 
1) differentiability (hand wave) 
2) Concavity (much stronger - harder to justify) 

Other reasons why not useful: 
- What happens when $X$ is a finite set? We can't talk about differentiability 
- Assumes cardinality that is problematic. Imagine changing units of measurement of $X$, $\max_{x}f(x,t)$. $x = \phi(y)$ where $\phi$ strictly increasing. $Y^{*}(t) = \arg\max_{y}f(\phi(y), t) \equiv \tilde{f}(y, t)$. Non-linearity of $\phi$ may cause problems on $f$ . 
- The approach doesn't survive if we make ordinal transformations on the function 


(Need to fill in notes from above and below - I got distracted - blame katie) 

### Properties of MCS

> f: $\mathbb{R}^{2}\to\mathbb{R}$ is SM if $\forall x'> x$, $t'>t$,

The $f(x', t) - f(x,t)$ is the benefit you get from increasing your choice from $x$ to $x'$ when the parameter is $t$. Similarly, for LHS with $t'$. Monotonicity says that we want to move up from $x$ to $x'$, but monotonicity also says that we also want to increase the choice when the parameter is higher $t\to t'$. 

If differentiable (for first-line) and twice cont differentiable (for second-line) then, 
$$
\begin{align}
\text{SM}  & \iff f_{x}(\cdot, t) \text{ increasing in } t  \\
 & \iff f_{xt}\geq 0
\end{align}
$$

$\forall x, x', t, t'$, 
$$
f(\max \{ x,x' \}, \max \{ t, t' \}) + f(\min \{ x, x' \}, \min \{ t, t' \})\geq f(x, t') + f(x', t)
$$

We an also rewrite
$$
f(x', t') + f(x, t)\geq f(x', t) + f(x, t') 
$$

If I want to go from $x$ to x' when the parameter is $t$, then I also want to go from $x\to x'$ when the parameter is larger at $t'$. Take an ordinal transformation of a function $f$, if $f$ is Single Crossing, then the ordinal transformation is single crossing. The previous definition is a cardinal property, but SC is a ordinal property. 

Why do we call this single crossing? 
Write a new function, fix $x'>x$, 
$$
g(t) = f(x', t) - f(x, t)
$$
If at any point $f(x', t)> f(x,t)$ then $f(x', t) - f(x, t)> 0$. Once I'm above a threshold, then everything to the right is above zero, and similarly, everything to the left will be below zero.

If it is Super Modular, then obviously it is Single Crossing. Single Crossing is a stronger result, but it is harder to check. We can check SM as long as it is differentiable, but SC harder to check, so we can use SM to prove SC. 

The SC condition tells us that the value of $g$ at $t$, once it crosses the horizontal axis, it stays above it, and negative to the left. Doesn't have to be strictly decreasing to the left, it just has to stay below the horizontal axis. 

##### SM SC 
$u: \mathbb{R}^{3}\to\mathbb{R}$, $u(x, y, t)$. We can draw indifference curves like below, 
![[Pasted image 20241111102059.png]]
Steeper indifference curve can only cross the flatter one once on the same curve. $t$ is not a choice variable but a parameter that defines it. 

The below shows $t''$ violates Spence Single Crossing: 
![[Pasted image 20241111102315.png]]

Fix $t$ for a moment. Let $h: X \to Y$. $h(x)$ is the $y$ that you get if you choose that $x$. The person with the flatter indifference curves will always choose something to the left of someone with steeper indifference curves. 

> [!proposition] 
> $u(x,y,t)$ satisfies SMSC iff $\forall h:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, $g(x,t)\equiv u(x, h(x), t)$ satisfies SC

Don't necessarily need to see the details.
