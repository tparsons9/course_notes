Each note is currently one of four types:

- **Definition**/**Example**, either of an `object` or of a `notion`, which links to:
    
    - Types: _Objects/notions of type `object`/`notion` with additional restrictions._
    - Examples: _Specific examples or counterexamples of `object`/`notion` (but not of any of its `types`)._
    - Constructions: _Objects/notions derived from `object`/`notion`._
    - Generalizations: _Abstractions of `object`/`notion`._  
          
        
    - Properties: _Statements regarding `object` or necessary conditions of `notion`._
    - Sufficiencies: _Proofs that other objects are of type `object` or sufficient conditions of `notion`_
    - Equivalences: _Equivalent definitions for `object` or biconditionals between notions and `notion`._
    - Justifications: _Proofs of well-definition of `object`/`notion`._
- **Proposition**/**Theorem** (differentiated by 'importance'), including both `statement` and `proof` regarding `object`/`notion`, which links to:
    
    - Proved by: _Statements in which `proof` depends crucially on._
    - References: _Notes in which the proofs of `statement` (or corollaries thereof) are delegated to._
    - Justifications: _Proofs of implicit assumptions of `object`/`notion` in `statement`._  
          
        
    - Specializations: _Reformulations/proofs of instances of `statement`._
    - Generalizations: _Statements and proofs of abstractions of `statement`._

These templates are automatically inserted whenever a note is created. After the links, the main content is written with remarks where appropriate.
